# Online Resource Search and Discovery Sandbox

Small set of scripts I made to build some experience retrieving data from Knowledge Graph (inc. Enterprise version), Google search, Bing search and WHOIS API. I was participating in a project that involved aggregating publicly available data related to a company based on the companys name or their website's URL. Running some parts of the code will require creating GCP project and following steps to use the project credentials.

As per coding standards, the code here is by no means a representation of what I consider a good coding practice. It is merely a playground to explore the available resources.
